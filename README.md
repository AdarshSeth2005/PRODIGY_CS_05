In, this project I have just created a "Packet sniffer Tool" that captures and analyzes network packets and display relevant information such as source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and payload data.

A Packet Sniffer Tool is a network analysis utility that captures and inspects data packets transmitted over a network. It helps users understand how data travels, detect issues, and monitor network traffic for performance or security analysis.

 Key Features:
 
i) Real-time Packet Capture: Monitors live network traffic and captures data packets as they flow through the network.

ii) Protocol Analysis: Identifies and displays details of various protocols (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, HTTP).

iii) Source/Destination Tracking: Extracts and shows source and destination IP addresses and port numbers.

iv) Packet Filtering: Allows users to filter specific packets based on protocol or address for focused analysis.

v) User Interface: Simple, intuitive layout to visualize and control the simulation or real-time monitoring process.

vi) Traffic Statistics: Offers insights into packet count, types, and size distribution.

*This tool is essential for anyone working in networking, cybersecurity, or system administration, offering hands-on insights into the inner workings of network communication.
